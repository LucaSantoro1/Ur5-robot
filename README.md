# Ur5-robot
This study introduces a 3D model
of the UR5 robotic manipulator, characterized by its 6 degrees of freedom.
In particular, the manipulator is not treated as rigid but it has flexible
joints, incorporating a harmonic drive system. Furthermore, a controller
is designed to govern the robot manipulator equipped with the harmonic
drive system. The entire system is implemented in Matlab/Simscape for
validation and demonstration of results
